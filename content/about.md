A Kotlin Multiplatform + Android developer who took the long but scenic route in finding what they absolutely love doing; Software Development.

In 2018 I left NASA to study full time at University of Maryland for a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After taking an introductory coding class, I was hooked.

I've always been into building my own computers, playing with Linux and Docker containers for various self-hosted services, writing shell scripts or minor python programs, etc. Something clicked in that class though, and I could not ignore it.

Being limited only by my imagination (instead of a piece of paper) was too tantalizing an opportunity to pass up. So, I turned all of my attention towards Software Development and haven't looked back.
