title = "About Me:"
+++

A Kotlin Multiplatform + Android developer who took the long but scenic  
route in finding what they absolutely love doing; Software Development.

In 2018 I left NASA to study full time at University of Maryland for a  
degree in Mechanical Engineering. After taking an introductory coding  
class, I was hooked.

I've always been into building my own computers, networking, running  
Linux boxes/VMs/Docker containers for various self-hosted services,  
writing scripts and minor python programs, etc. Something clicked in  
that class, though, and I could not ignore it.

Being limited only by my imagination (instead of a piece of paper) was too  
tantalizing an opportunity to pass up. So, I turned all of my attention  
towards Software Development and haven't looked back.

## Capable:
Have both supported and led in team environments. Extremely fast learner,  
picking up on new skills and information easily. Accomplished in developing  
and implementing solutions to complex technical problems.

## Interests:
